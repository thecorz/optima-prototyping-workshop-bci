# OPTIMA Prototyping Workshop: Medical Imaging Analysis Using AI

This repository contains the resources and code for two AI-based medical imaging tasks. These tasks involve analyzing different types of medical images to aid in diagnosis and classification.

---

## Project Overview

This project includes two primary tasks using artificial intelligence for medical imaging:

1. **Breast Lesion and Molecular Subtypes Prediction in Mammograms**
2. **Tissue Classification in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)**

Each task leverages AI techniques to process medical imaging data, providing insights that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnostic and treatment planning.

## Tasks

### 1. Breast Lesion and Molecular Subtypes Prediction in Mammograms

- **Objective**: To predict breast lesion characteristics and molecular subtypes from mammographic images.
- **Data**: Mammogram images annotated with lesion types and molecular subtypes.
- **AI Techniques**: Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and prediction.
- **Applications**: This model can help in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for breast cancer patients.

### 2. Tissue Classification in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)

- **Objective**: To classify different tissue types in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for diagnostic support in histopathology.
- **Data**: High-resolution WSI data with annotated tissue classes.
- **AI Techniques**: Models optimized for high-resolution images, including patch-based CNN approaches and transfer learning.
- **Applications**: Tissue classification assists pathologists in identifying and distinguishing between tissue types, supporting accurate and timely diagnoses.
